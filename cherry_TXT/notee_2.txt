changig ownership of file of folder nb -R is for recursive in folder no need to use in file
sudo chown -R user file/foldername eg  for users 

sudo chgrp -R groupname file/foldername eg 



changing file or folder permission
- rwx rw- r-- this means is a file the first - then rwx is for the owner of file can read write and execute the file the second rw- is for group can read write but cannot executusers can only read but cannot write or execute the file
u -user  eg chmod o+w filename or o-w filename chmod 754 filename 
g- group 
o- other

sudo chmod 777 filename/foldername  -r ie -r means recursive you do not need to change file down again

0 - means no permission eg -
1 - means execute eg +x
2 - means write eg w
4 - means read eg r   

so if you see 765 -means you are giving first group all permission ie 4+2+1  second group 4+2 and third group 4  
 673  this means your giving first group 4+2 second group 4+2+1 and third group 4+0+1
