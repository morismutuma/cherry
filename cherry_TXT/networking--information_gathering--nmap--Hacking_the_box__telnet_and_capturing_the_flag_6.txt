   - first connect to the box by using the vpn file you downloaded and run  the command  in your linux terminal
   - sudo openvpn  morism.vpn

     second gather information to see which port are open 
       
       - you can run various command here using nmap
       
      sudo nmap -p 22,23,53,80  10.129.90.129  -the ip is the ip of the box or target machine port you can scan any of your like
      
        
        
     then from image you can see the open ports so you can use searchsploit tool to gather more information on open port
     - use command 
     searchsploit telnet  -telnet is name of service of open port
     
     hhhh

     then after that  you can use still search sploit to help you locate various file 
     
          -searchsploit -x linux_mips/27132.txt
